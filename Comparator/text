difference between Comparable and Comparator in Java and provide some code examples.

Comparable and Comparator are both interfaces in Java that are used to sort objects. However, they are used in slightly different ways.

Comparable is an interface that is used to sort objects in their natural ordering. 
It contains only one method, compareTo(), which defines the ordering. When you implement the Comparable interface, 
you need to override the compareTo() method and define the ordering that you want to use. Here's an example:

public class Employee implements Comparable<Employee> {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private long salary;

    public Employee(int id, String name, int age, long salary) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Employee emp) {
        //let's sort the employee based on an id in ascending order
        //returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this employee id
        //is less than, equal to, or greater than the specified object.
        return (this.id - emp.id);
    }

    //other methods
}
